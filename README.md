### Lucas Klassmann

Most recently I have been working as a Senior Software Developer at [Sheetgo](https://www.sheetgo.com/). I started working with programming in 2004. I worked with  many languages and platforms, but my favorites languages are C, Python, Go, Lua on a Linux environment. In my career I have been focusing more on the back-end, improving my system design and system programming skills. I also enjoy studying more about Operating Systems and Computer Architecture.
