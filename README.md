I am a Senior Software Engineer in the back-end and performance team at [Sheetgo](https://www.sheetgo.com/). My journey in programming started in **2004**. My projects include **C**, **Python**, **Go**, and **Lua** in a Linux environment. I like to improve my skills in system design, system programming, performance, and problem-solving. I also enjoy learning more about operating systems, and computer architecture, and doing my projects in game development.
